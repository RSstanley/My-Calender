2. Challenges

 Most Difficult Technical Challenge (More than 200 words):
During this second week, the most challenging technical hurdle was integrating third-party calendar APIs seamlessly. The initial research indicated a straightforward process, but the practical implementation posed intricate challenges. Compatibility issues, inconsistent data formats, and varying authentication methods across different providers led to unexpected complexities.

Addressing these challenges required a more in-depth understanding of each API's documentation, thorough testing, and iterative debugging. The need to ensure a seamless user experience heightened the importance of resolving these technical intricacies promptly. Ultimately, overcoming this challenge involved a combination of online community support, collaboration with experienced developers, and relentless testing to ensure robust API integration.

 Most Difficult Non-Technical Challenge (More than 200 words):
The most challenging non-technical aspect this week centered around effective time management. Balancing project commitments with personal and professional responsibilities proved demanding. Unforeseen personal commitments and unexpected events disrupted the planned work schedule, resulting in sporadic periods of productivity.

To address this challenge, a more structured approach to time management was adopted. Prioritizing tasks, setting clear daily goals, and leveraging time management tools became essential. Additionally, proactive communication with stakeholders and the implementation of asynchronous collaboration tools helped mitigate the impact of schedule misalignments.
